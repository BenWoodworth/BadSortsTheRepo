# [Gnomesort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_sort)

# Dependencies

- I recommend the [g++](https://www.cprogramming.com/g++.html) compiler, and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)

# Running

- Compile the program by running `make`
- Run the program with ./gnomesort
  - You'll probably have to `chmod +x ./gnomesort` to give the binary execution permissions
  - You can either enter you input by hand here and end with `ctrl-d`...
  - OR you can `cat` an input file into the binary (`cat input.txt | ./gnomesort`)

## Example

```
$ ./gnomesort
5

^D
---Thanks for the input!---
Here it is in sorted order:

1
2
